## DNN (Deep Neural Networks) For Recognition and Classification

The deep learning that implemented on Jetson Tx2 does not only classify the image as source, it also has ability to use the camera to perform the real time classification. Moreover, by adapting the well-trained model to another functionality, the Jetson Tx2 can finish tasks such as face detection and human body movement detection. ECE 480 Design Team fifteen will provide solution that implements all the works on this new technology platform. The system interacts with Tx2 development kit, one external camera and other components.
